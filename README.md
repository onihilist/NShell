If you have any problem with **NihilistShell**, or it locks you out of a proper shell,  
you can forcefully switch back to `bash` like this:

```bash
sudo sed -i "s|/usr/local/bin/nihilistshell|/bin/bash|" /etc/passwd
```

If you got the error "bad interpreter" when running `install.sh` try to run this :

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dos2unix
dos2unix install.sh
```
