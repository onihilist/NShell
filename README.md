### üé® Custom themes

This is a little exemple of an custom theme.</br>
If you are using `format_top/bottom` & `corner_top/bottom`, `format` will be ignored.</br>
For making a single line prompt use `format`, and double line `format_top/bottom`.</br>
Exemple :
```json
{
  "name": "test",
  "format": "[bold green][[{user}@{host}]][/][white][[{cwd}]] >>[/]",
  "format_top": "[bold cyan]{user}@{host}[/]",
  "format_bottom": "[bold yellow]{cwd}[/]",
  "corner_top": "[bold magenta]\u250c[/]",
  "corner_bottom": "[bold magenta]\u2514[/]",
  "ls_colors": "di=34:fi=37:ln=36:pi=33:so=35:ex=32"
}
```

The name of the theme is `test`, no matter what the file is named.</br>
So enter the command : `settheme test`.</br>
This is the result :

### üîß Troubleshooting

If you have any problem with **NihilistShell**, or it locks you out of a proper shell,  
you can forcefully switch back to `bash` like this:

```bash
sudo sed -i "s|/usr/local/bin/nihilistshell|/bin/bash|" /etc/passwd
```

If you got the error "bad interpreter" when running `install.sh` try to run this :

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dos2unix
dos2unix install.sh
```
